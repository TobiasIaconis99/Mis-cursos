1-Look, see and watch, no significa ver,
    look es ver de poner el foco en algo
    see es ver de poder ver en si 
    y watch es observar algo con detalle, como prestandole atencion, cuando identeficas alguna cosa
    en algo, por ejemplo: watch this wall, por ejemplo en este caso note, manchas en la pared 

las tres se podrian traduxcir como mirar
